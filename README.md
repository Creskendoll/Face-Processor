# Face-Processor
A program which analyses images, and videos in order to get information about the faces within the frames. The program utilizes Microsoft Azure cognitive services using their API. At the current version the program is built to first cut frames out of a video file and analyse those frames for faces. Processing a video feed frame for frame is costly and since the web request takes time to result it is not possible. 

## Getting the frames
First you have to have recorded a video preferably as an mp4.
